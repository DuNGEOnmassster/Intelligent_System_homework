Missionaries and Cannibals cross the river with single boat

Each transport should satisfy two conditions: 

1. every time in every side should have M >= C

2. every time in boat should have M >= C and M + C < K

Otherwise Missionaries will be eaten by Cannibals.

Find the transport solution and draw every states.
